## task 2-ATM INTEFACE
In cities, we commonly come across ATMs that were created with Java programming. This project is made up of four classes: BankAccount, ATMInterface, and Main. The BankAccount class keeps the account balance, whereas the ATM class performs transactions like withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. The ATMInterface class provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the ATM, allowing users to choose actions and receive feedback. The Main class initializes the system and launches the interface. Users may do basic banking actions such as withdrawing, depositing, checking their balance, and exiting, with correct validation and message for each.
task 3-Number Guessing

  A number guessing game in Java! The system generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has 10 attempts to guess it. There are 3 rounds, each scored as 10 minus the number of attempts taken. The total score out of 30 is displayed after 3 rounds. Access the code on my GitHub, play it in any online Java compiler, and please leave your feedback in the comment section .
